# Payroll Fraud Detection (AI-Powered)

## Overview
The **Payroll Fraud Detection** system was initially built using rule-based detection mechanisms. However, these static rules were prone to manipulation and required constant updates by administrators. To overcome these limitations, we developed an **AI-powered fraud detection solution** using a **Decision Tree Classifier** model, which dynamically identifies fraudulent transactions based on historical payroll data.

## Problem Statement
Traditional fraud detection relied on predefined rules that:
- Were manually set and could be easily bypassed.
- Required frequent updates, making maintenance cumbersome.
- Lacked adaptability to new fraud patterns.

Our **ML-based solution** overcomes these challenges by learning from historical data and adapting to new fraud patterns dynamically.

## Solution Approach
1. **Data Collection**: Aggregated historical payroll transaction data, including fraudulent and non-fraudulent cases.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Identified key attributes contributing to fraud (e.g., unusual bonus amounts, duplicate payments, salary spikes).
3. **Model Selection**: Implemented a **Decision Tree Classifier** to categorize transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.
4. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Trained the model using labeled data and evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Integration**: Deployed the ML model into the existing system, replacing static rules with an adaptive, real-time fraud detection mechanism.

## Features
- **Automated Fraud Detection**: No manual rule updates required.
- **Real-time Predictions**: Processes payroll transactions and flags anomalies instantly.
- **Explainability**: Decision Tree model provides interpretable fraud detection logic.
- **Admin Overrides**: Allows human review and rule adjustments if necessary.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/FastAPI) or Java (Spring Boot) for integration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / HanaDB / MySQL
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes (if applicable)
- **Monitoring**: ELK Stack / Prometheus + Grafana
